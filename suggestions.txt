TheWarKid 1/25/2018: A control pannel in J.I Defense, that has control over all the turrets it's linked to. It holds the whitelist for who not to shoot. Capture that, and it removes everyone but the person who captured it from the whitelist. This makes it so the Turrets and users have something to defend, while allowing multiple people not to get shot by the turrets, allowing for more people in a location that needs defending.

TheWarKid 2/23/2018: JIDS, a item that, once you have it in your inventory, will provide a hud warning that you're currently being target by a turret, along with a rough estimate of it's direction if you have it held in your hand. It will solve the problem if always afraid there's some Anti Material Rifle across the map targeting you, and so that it wont take 30 minutes to find the turret aswell.
